# What I did:
In this project, I have crafted stunning and effective dashboards. I cover everything from data preparation to advanced design techniques, transforming data into compelling visual stories. 
- Use Power Query Editor to clean and transform data. This includes removing duplicates, handling missing values, and formatting data types.
- Import Data
- Data Modeling:
    - Relationships: Define relationships between different tables in dataset
   - Create Measures and Calculated Columns: Use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create measures and calculated columns for more complex data calculations.
- Use Slicers and Filters: Add slicers and filters to allow users to interact with the data dynamically.
- Add Visuals
- Format Visuals: Customize the appearance of visuals by adjusting colors, fonts, and sizes to match your desired design.
